# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2019-04-13
### Added
 - Support for _accepting_ 2, 4, 8 and 10 figure Ordnance Survey references (6 figure was already supported)
### Changed
 - fromSixFigureReference
 - All value objects are now immutable - calling a conversion function on them now returns a *new* object rather than modifying the existing one  
 - Minimum PHP version is now 7.1
### Removed
 - HHVM support now that project has a stated goal of no longer targeting PHP7 compatibility
 - `OSRef::fromSixFigureReference()` has been removed, use `OSRef::fromGridReference()` instead
 - `OSRef::to[Two/Four/Six/Eight/Ten]FigureReference()` have been removed, use `OSRef::toGridReference($length)` instead

### Added
 - Added distance calculations for grid-based co-ordinate systems to complement the existing lat/long implementation

## [1.1.2] - 2015-12-31
### Fixed

## 1.0.0 - 2014-01-23
Initial release of this fork (based off of v2.3 of original)
### Fixed
 - When converting Latitude and Longitude between WGS84 and OSGB36 or vice-versa, a wrong constant for the y translation has been corrected (was off by 1 metre)
### Changed
 - Eastings and northings are rounded to 1m, and lat/long to 5dp (approx 1m) to avoid any misconceptions that precision is the same thing as accuracy.
 - When calculating surface distances, a more accurate mean radius is now used rather than that derived from historical definitions of a nautical mile
